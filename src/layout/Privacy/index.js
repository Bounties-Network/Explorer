        </b>
        A cookie (“Cookie”) is a small text file that is placed on your hard
        drive by a web page server. Cookies contain information that can later
        be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
        Some of the cookies will only be used if you use certain features or
        select certain preferences, and some cookies will always be used. You
        can find out more about each cookie by viewing our current cookie list
        below. We update this list periodically, so there may be additional
        cookies that are not yet listed. Web beacons, tags and scripts may be
        used in the Site or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count
        visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine
