      <p>
        IMPORTANT NOTICE: THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO BINDING ARBITRATION AND A
        WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION RIGHTS AS DETAILED IN SECTION 24. PLEASE READ THE
        AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.
      </p>
      <h4> 1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h4>
      <p>
        ConsenSys AG's Bounties Network (“Bounties”) is a blockchain based
        network that allows Users to easily outsource the completion of any
        Task, paying in Ether or any ERC20 compatible token. “Tasks” means any
        service a Site participant requests or performs. Site participants may
        consist of (a) those who post Tasks to Bounties (individually an
        “Issuer,” collectively the “Issuers”); (b) those who fulfill Tasks
        (individually a “Fulfiller” or collectively the “Fulfillers”); and (c)
        those who interact with the Bounties site but do not post or fulfill
        Tasks (a “Visitor,” Issuers, Fulfillers, and Visitors collectively
        referred to as “Users”). The Bounties website (https://bounties.network,
        the "Site") serves as a registration portal, product offering, and an
        overview of the Bounties services. The Site also includes text, images,
        audio, code and other materials or third party information. The Site and
        any other features, tools, materials, or services offered from time to
        time by Bounties, including our network infrastructure, is referred to
        herein as the “Service.” Please read these Terms of Use (the “Terms” or
        “Terms of Use”) carefully before using the Service. By using or
        otherwise accessing the Services, or clicking to accept or agree to
        these Terms where that option is made available, you (x) accept and
        agree to these Terms (y) consent to the collection, use, disclosure and
        other handling of information as described in our{' '}
        <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and (z) any additional terms,
        rules and conditions of participation issued by Bounties from time to
        time. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS, THEN YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE
        THE SERVICES.
      </p>
      <h4> 2. MODIFICATIONS OF TERMS OF USE</h4>
      <p>
        Except for Section 24, which provides for binding arbitration and a
        waiver of class action rights, Bounties reserves the right, at its sole
        discretion, to modify or replace the Terms of Use at any time. The most
        current version of these Terms will be posted on our Site. You are
        responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such
        modifications. Use of the Services at any time constitutes your
        acceptance of the Terms of Use as modified as of such time.
      </p>
      <h4> 3. ELIGIBILITY</h4>
      <p>
        You represent and warrant that you: (a) are of legal age to form a
        binding contract; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from
        using our Services; and (c) have full power and authority to enter into
        this agreement and in doing so will not violate any other agreement to
        which you are a party. If you are registering to use the Services on
        behalf of a legal entity, you further represent and warrant that (x)
        such legal entity is duly organized and validly existing under the
        applicable laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, and (y) you are
        duly authorized by such legal entity to act on its behalf.
      </p>
      <h4>4. ROLE OF BOUNTIES</h4>
      <p>
        You expressly acknowledge, agree, and understand that: the Site is
        merely a platform through which Issuers and Fulfillers conduct
        transactions. Unless participating on the Site as a Issuer, Bounties is
        not involved in the transactions, and has no control over the quality,
        safety, or legality of Tasks or consideration for Tasks, the ability of
        Fulfillers to perform Tasks to Issuers’ satisfaction, or the ability of
        Issuers to pay for Tasks. You are not an employee of Bounties, and
        Bounties does not, in any way, screen, supervise, direct, or control
        Fulfillers or services performed for or delivered to Issuers (“Fulfiller
        Services”). Bounties will not have any liability or obligations under or
        related to Service Contracts (defined below) for any acts or omissions
        by you or other Users. Bounties has no control over Fulfillers or the
        Fulfiller Services offered or rendered by Fulfillers and Bounties makes
        no representations as to the reliability, capability, or qualifications
        of any Fulfiller or the quality, security, or legality of any Fulfiller
        Services, and Bounties disclaims any and all liability relating thereto.
        Use of the Site is at your own risk. Because Bounties is not a party to
        the transactions between Issuers and Fulfillers, Bounties is not
        responsible for resolving any disputes between participants related to
        any Tasks.
      </p>
      <h4>5. BOUNTIES ISSUERS</h4>
      <p>
        As an Issuer, you agree that: (a) you will interact with Bounty
        Fulfillers in a professional and courteous manner, and accurately
        describe your Task; (b) you may only use the Site for business,
        commercial, or research purposes; (c) payment will be issued and
        remitted to Fulfillers upon the your approval of the deliverables of the
        Task; (d) payment is not refundable; (e) you will not reject Tasks
        performed by Hunters without good cause; and (f) you will not post a
        Task that violates any part of section 12 of the Terms.
      </p>
      <h4>6. BOUNTIES FULFILLERS</h4>
      <p>
        As a Fulfiller, you agree that: (a) you will interact with Issuers in a
        professional and courteous manner, and provide reasonably requested
        information in connection with your performance of Tasks; (b) you will
        perform Tasks in a competent and workmanlike manner; (c) you will supply
        complete, accurate, non-malicious information for all Tasks you perform;
        (d) you will not submit anything to Issuer that violates section 12 of
        the Terms; and (e) Issuers may passively reject Tasks you perform for
        good cause and currently there is no way for a Fulfiller to dispute any
        rejection of a submission made through the Site, meaning you may not be
        paid if an Issuer rejects your submission.
      </p>
      <h4> 7. WORK PRODUCT AND WORK FOR HIRE</h4>
      <p>
        Fulfiller will perform the Fulfiller Services in a professional and
        workmanlike manner and will timely deliver any agreed upon tangible or
        intangible results or deliverables, including, but not limited to,
        configurations, computer programs, software, applications, or other
        information, and any intellectual property developed in connection
        therewith (“Work Product”). Where applicable, the Work Product must be
        submitted to Issuer in open source format.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any Work Product from Tasks performed as a Fulfiller is a "work made for
        hire" for the benefit of the Issuer. Upon Fulfiller’s receipt of full
        payment from Issuer, the Work Product, including without limitation all
        patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights
        of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill,
        trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now
        exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore
        and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of
        any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction (“Intellectual
        Property Rights”) in the Work Product, will be the sole and exclusive
        property of Issuer, and Issuer will be deemed to be the author thereof.
        If Fulfiller has any Intellectual Property Rights to the Work Product
        that are not owned by Issuer upon Fulfiller’s receipt of payment from
        Client, Fulfiller hereby automatically irrevocably assigns to Client all
        right, title and interest worldwide in and to such Intellectual Property
        Rights. Except as set forth above, Fulfiller retains no rights to use,
        and will not challenge the validity of Issuer’s ownership in, such
        Intellectual Property Rights. Fulfiller hereby waives any moral rights,
        rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure and withdrawal or inalienable
        rights under applicable law in and to the Work Product.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Fulfiller agrees that it will not incorporate into Work Product or
        otherwise supply Issuer any deliverable for which the use or
        distribution of the code will create (or purport to create) obligations
        for Issuer to grant any rights or immunities under Issuer’s intellectual
        property to a third-party, including without limitation any obligation
        that the Work Product or Issuer software combined with, derived from, or
        distributed with such Work Product (a) be disclosed or distributed in
        source code form, (b) be licensed for the purpose of making derivative
        works, or (c) be redistributable at no charge.
      </p>
      <h4>8. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS</h4>
      <p>
        Fulfillers perform Tasks for Issuers in their personal capacity as an
        independent contractor and not as an employee of an Issuer or Bounties.
        As a Fulfiller, you agree that: (a) you are responsible for and will
        comply with all applicable laws and registration requirements, including
        those applicable to independent contractors and maximum working hours
        regulations; (b) these Terms do not create an association, joint
        venture, partnership, franchise, or employer/employee relationship
        between you and Issuer, or you and Bounties; (iii) you will not
        represent yourself as an employee or agent of an Issuer or Bounties;
        (iv) you will not be entitled to any of the benefits that an Issuer or
        Bounties may make available to its employees, such as vacation pay, sick
        leave, and insurance programs, including group health insurance or
        retirement benefits; and (v) you are not eligible to recover worker's
        compensation benefits in the event of injury. As an independent
        contractor, Fulfiller is free at all times to provide Fulfiller Services
        to persons or businesses other than Issuer, including any competitor of
        Issuer. Fulfiller does not have authority to enter into written or oral
        (whether implied or express) contracts on behalf of Issuer or Bounties.
        As an Issuer, you will not engage a Fulfiller in any way that may
        jeopardize that Fulfiller’s status as an independent contractor
        performing Tasks for you. Issuers may not require an exclusive
        relationship.
      </p>
      <h4>9. BOUNTIES CONTRACTS</h4>
      <p>
        As used herein, a “Service Contract” means, as applicable, the
        unilateral contractual provisions created by Issuer that govern the
        Fulfiller Services to be performed by Fulfiller for Issuer for a
        particular Task posted to the Site and which will typically include a
        description of the Task or Tasks to be completed, the amount and type of
        currency as compensation, and the deadline. You acknowledge and agree
        that Bounties is not a party to any Service Contracts, and that the
        formation of a Service Contract between any Issuers and Fulfillers will
        not, under any circumstance, create an employment or other service
        relationship between Bounties and Issuer or Bounties and Fulfiller.
      </p>
      <h4>10. PAYMENT</h4>
      <p>
        In order to use Site Services, each User must provide its Ethereum
        wallet address. The Site and the Site Services operate with Ether or
        ERC20 compatible tokens. Payment to Fulfillers will occur upon Issuer’s
        acceptance of Fulfiller’s Work Product. Acceptance of a Fulfiller’s Work
        Product is at the sole discretion of the Issuer.
      </p>
      <h4>11. USER PROFILE</h4>
      <p>
        Users of Bounties have the option to create a profile (“Profile”), which
        you consent to be shown to other Users. You represent and warrant that
        you will use your Profile to market your business to others for the
        purpose of entering into independent contractor relationships with other
        Users. You agree to provide true, accurate, and complete information on
        your Profile and all registration and other forms you access on the Site
        or provide to us and to update your information to maintain its
        truthfulness, accuracy, and completeness. You agree not to provide any
        information about your work experience, your skills, or the services you
        provide that is or becomes false or misleading. You agree not to ask or
        allow another person to create a Profile on your behalf, for your use,
        or for your benefit.

      <h4>24. BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h4>
      <p>
        PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR
        LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT
      </p>
      <h5>24.1. Initial Dispute Resolution</h5>
      <p>
        The parties shall use their best efforts to engage directly to settle
        any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith
        negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a
        lawsuit or arbitration.
      </p>
      <h5>24.2. Binding Arbitration</h5>
      <p>
        If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of
        30 days from the time informal dispute resolution under the Initial
        Dispute Resolution provision begins, then either party may initiate
        binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the
        terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or
        relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance and
        breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of
        the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered
        by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the
        provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary
        procedures for consumer related disputes of the American Arbitration
        Association (the “AAA”), excluding any rules or procedures governing or
        permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or
        local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all
        disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation,
        applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including,
        but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are
        void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The
        arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be
        available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award
        shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a
        judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties understand
        that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue
        in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some
        instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation
        and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in
        court.
      </p>
      <h5>24.3. Location</h5>
      <p>
        Binding arbitration shall take place in New York. You agree to submit to
        the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New York
        County, New York, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings
        pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on
        the award entered by the arbitrator.
      </p>
      <h5>24.4. Class Action Waiver</h5>
      <p>
        The parties further agree that any arbitration or other permitted action
        shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a
        class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly
        waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class
        basis. YOU AND BOUNTIES AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
        OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR
        CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any
        court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in
        this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an
        arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision
        set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the
        parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
      </p>
      <h5>
        24.5. Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims
        Court Claims
      </h5>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding the parties&#39; decision to resolve all disputes
        through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or
        federal court to protect its patents, copyrights, moral rights,
        trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights
        (“Intellectual Property Rights”). Either party may also seek relief in a
        small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that
        court’s jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <h5>24.6. 30-Day Right to Opt Out</h5>
      <p>
        You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and
        class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice
        of your decision to opt-out to the following address: Bounties ℅
        ConsenSys, 49 Bogart Street, Brooklyn NY 11206 and via email at
        notices@consensys.net, with the following subject line: “Bounties LEGAL
        OPT OUT”. The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of
        the Service otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in
        accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these
        arbitration provisions, Bounties also will not be bound by them.
      </p>
      <h5>24.7. Changes to this Section</h5>
      <p>
        Bounties will provide 60-days’ notice of any changes to this section.
        Changes will become effective on the 60th day, and will apply
        prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day. For any
        dispute not subject to arbitration, you and Bounties agree to submit to
        the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and
        state courts located in New York, New York. You further agree to accept
        service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional
        and venue defenses otherwise available. The Terms and the relationship
        between you and Bounties shall be governed by the laws of the State of
        New York without regard to conflict of law provisions.
      </p>
      <h4>25. RELEASE</h4>
      <p>
        In addition to the recognition that Bounties is not a party to any
        Service Contract between Users, you hereby release Bounties, our
        affiliates, and our respective officers, directors, agents,
        subsidiaries, joint ventures, and employees from claims, demands, and
        damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and
        unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any dispute you
        have with another User, whether it be at law or in equity. This release
        includes, for example and without limitation, any disputes regarding the
        performance, functions, and quality of the work provided to the Bounties
        Issuer and requests for refunds based upon disputes.
      </p>
      <p>
        TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE, YOU HEREBY WAIVE THE PROTECTIONS OF CALIFORNIA
        CIVIL CODE § 1542 (AND ANY ANALOGOUS LAW IN ANY OTHER APPLICABLE
        JURISDICTION) WHICH SAYS: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS
        WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR
        AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST
        HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”
      </p>
      <h4>26. GENERAL INFORMATION</h4>
      <h5>26.1. Entire Agreement</h5>
      <p>
        These Terms (and any additional terms, rules and conditions of
        participation that Bounties may post on the Service) constitute the
        entire agreement between you and Bounties with respect to the Service
        and supersedes any prior agreements, oral or written, between you and
        Bounties. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the
        additional terms, rules and conditions of participation, the latter will
        prevail over the Terms to the extent of the conflict.
      </p>
      <h5>26.2. Waiver and Severability of Terms</h5>
      <p>
        The failure of Bounties to exercise or enforce any right or provision of
        the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If
        any provision of the Terms is found by an arbitrator or court of
        competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree
        that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the
        parties&#39; intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other
        provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect.
      </p>
      <h5>26.3. Statute of Limitations</h5>
      <p>
        You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any
        claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the use of the
        Service or the Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim
        or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
      </p>
